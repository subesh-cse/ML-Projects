# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects Series

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Repository!  
This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level machine learning projects that I have completed to learn, practice, and showcase practical ML skills using real-world datasets.

Each project includes:
- Clean and documented Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)
- Visualizations and evaluation metrics
- A separate `README.md` for quick understanding
- End-to-end model building (from data preprocessing to evaluation)
