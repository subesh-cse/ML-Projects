# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is a classic **binary classification** machine learning task that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not, based on features like age, gender, class, and more.

## 🔍 Overview

The Titanic dataset is often used as an entry point to learn:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation

This notebook uses the **Seaborn Titanic dataset**, which is pre-cleaned and ideal for practice and GitHub deployment.

## 🧠 What the Model Predicts

> **Goal:** Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster (`1 = Survived`, `0 = Did not survive`).

### Features used:
- `sex`
- `age`
- `pclass` (passenger class)
- `fare`
- `embarked`
- `sibsp` and `parch` (family aboard)

## 📈 Model Performance

| Metric              | Score  |
|---------------------|--------|
| **Accuracy**        | ~79%   |
| **Precision/Recall**| Balanced |
| **Confusion Matrix**| ✅ Visualized in notebook |
